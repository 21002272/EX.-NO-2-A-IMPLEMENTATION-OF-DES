# EX.-NO-2-A-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DES

## AIM:
  To write a program to implement Data Encryption Standard (DES).

## ALGORITHM:

  STEP-1: Read the 64-bit plain text.
  
  STEP-2: Split it into two 32-bit blocks and store it in two different arrays.
  
  STEP-3: Perform XOR operation between these two arrays.
  
  STEP-4: The output obtained is stored as the second 32-bit sequence and the original second 32-bit sequence forms the first part.
  
  STEP-5: Thus the encrypted 64-bit cipher text is obtained in this way. Repeat the same process for the remaining plain text characters.
  
## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:

  Thus the data encryption standard algorithm had been implemented successfully.
